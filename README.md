This is a rudimentary Breakout game that the user will play in Terminal. 

It was built utilizing starter code used in Pygame Lab (details below).

The current skateboard version contains a paddle and a ball that, when they collide with one another causes the ball to bounce, reversing direction. 

Everytime the ball and paddle collide the user gets a point.  

When the ball and paddle do not collide the ball resets from the top of the screen. 

Future versions will include bricks with additional scoring logic and ball tracking.
